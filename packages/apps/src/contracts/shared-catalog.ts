/**
 * A `HostedSharedCatalog` both ways: the bundle shares a catalog, the host restores it.
 *
 * Routers such as the OpenAPI importer give every tool's schema a `$defs` of its own, holding the
 * definitions it reaches: the same object for each tool that reaches one. A densely connected
 * document, one whose resources expand into each other, reaches most of its definitions from
 * every tool, so writing each tool's copy multiplies the document by its tool count. Stripe's
 * 8 MB description became 384 million characters, and its schemas' `$defs` name about 330,000
 * entries, though only a few hundred `$defs` differ.
 *
 * `shareCatalog` writes each definition once and each distinct `$defs` once. `restoreSharedCatalog`
 * puts them back: each tool's schemas are again, as JSON, those the bundle evaluated, and tools
 * whose `$defs` were equal share one object for it, so the host holds each `$defs` once.
 *
 * Definitions are matched by object, not by text: matching by text would first write every copy,
 * which is the cost sharing avoids. Copies that are distinct objects stay distinct. Two `$defs` are
 * equal when they name the same definitions under the same names, in the same order.
